### 👾 The Game

Flappy Bird is a 2013 mobile game developed by the Vietnamese video game artist and programmer [Dong Nguyen](https://twitter.com/dongatory), under his game development company [.Gears](https://dotgears.com). The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

### 👩🏽‍💻 Motivation

My motivation is to reproduce some old famous games while studying game development for mobile devices. You can find the YouTube video which I followed for the base project here:
